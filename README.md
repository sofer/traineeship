# The Founders & Coders traineeship

## Why?
Our aim is to help our students—school leavers, jobseekers and university graduates alike—develop those skills for which there is a high demand in the job market and which, for reasons outlined in Professor Alison Wolf's report for the Policy Institute, [*"Heading for the precipice"*](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/publications/Issuesandideas-alison-wolf-digital.pdf), they may not easily be able to develop elsewhere.

##How?
We base all our programmes on peer-led learning. We encourage our students to become good at helping each other as a way to improve their own understanding. We aim to staff our training programmes largely with graduates of those programmes.

All of the graduates from our most recent cohort are now working as software developers. Our experience is largely with graduate-level trainees but we relish the opportunity to test the quality of our training programme with other demographics. We have a growing network of employment partners. When graduates of our traineeship are ready for work, we will do everything we can to place them. We will also offer promising candidates the opportunity to apply for our advanced programme, which is almost guaranteed to lead to employment.
