# The Founders & Coders traineeship

## Why?
As Professor Alison Wolf makes clear in her recent report for the Policy Institute, [*"Heading for the precipice"*](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/publications/Issuesandideas-alison-wolf-digital.pdf), traditional vocational training is in crisis in this country and routes into the digital sector are effectively closed off for the vast majority of the population.

Our aim is to help our students—school leavers, jobseekers and university graduates alike—develop those skills for which there is a high and growing demand in the job market.

##How?
We base all our programmes on peer-led learning. We encourage our students to become good at helping each other as a way to improve their own understanding. We aim to staff our training programmes largely with graduates of those programmes. 

## What?

### The traineeship
*Develop the skills you need to take charge of your life. Think like a founder. Become a software developer*.

### Curriculum
+ Learn to code: become a software developer
+ Think like a founder: plan the next game-changing startup
+ Get creative: design products that will change the world
+ Be productive: master the Google apps suite
+ Learn to search: use the web to find what you want
+ Impress the world: create a great online profile for yourself 

### Job opportunities people move into
In the space of little over a year, we have developed a fantastic reputation with employers for producing high-quality candidates for jobs in which there is an acute skills shortage. All 16 of the graduates from our Summer 2015 cohort are now working as software developers. 

Our experience is largely with graduate-level trainees, but we are now adapting our methods for training programmes with other demographics and we have a growing network of employment partners with whom we have already established a relationship. 

When graduates of our traineeship are ready for work, we will do everything we can to place them. We will offer promising candidates the opportunity to continue working with us on our traineeship programme and eventually to apply for our advanced programme, which is very likely to lead to employment in a graduate-level job.
